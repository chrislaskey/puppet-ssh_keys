About
================================================================================

A custom puppet module for automating SSH key creation and deployment between
source and target machines.

Example
-------

On the source machine define as many ssh_keys as needed. Below is a list of
parameters and their default values:

	ssh_keys::create { "remote-target.example.com":
		local_user => "deploy",
		target_port => "22",
		target_user => "deploy",
		disable_key_fingerprint_check => "false",
  	  	puppet_key_dir => "/data/ssh-keys",
	}

The target machine:

	class { "ssh_keys::authorize":
  	  	puppet_key_dir => "/data/ssh-keys",
	}

**Note** since `ssh_keys::authorize` is a class, it only needs to be
called once per node, unlike `ssh_keys::create` which requires a definition
for each key pair.

File Server Setup
-----------------

A custom Puppet File Server location is required on the Puppet Master. Add
a `[ssh-keys]` entry to `/etc/puppet/fileserver.conf`. The recommended
entry is:

  	[ssh-keys]
      	path /etc/puppet/ssh-keys/public/%H
      	allow *

This stores the public keys in the default location `/etc/puppet/ssh-keys/<target-fqdn>`.

If using a path other than `/etc/puppet/ssh-keys` make sure to pass in the new
location as a parameter in the node definitions:

	class { "ssh_keys::authorize":
		puppet_key_dir => "/new/path/here"
	}

	ssh_keys::create { "deploy":
  	  	puppet_key_dir => "/new/path/here",
	}

**Note** the `puppet_key_dir` parameter should only be passed if using
something other than the default `/etc/puppet/ssh-keys` directory.

For more information on Puppet File Servers see the [Puppet
Documentation](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-docs/blob/master/source/guides/file_serving.markdown).

How it works
------------

The source machine (holder of the private key) runs the Puppet catalog. A new
SSH key pair is created on the Puppet Master. The Puppet Master stores the
public key, and the private key is transferred to the source machine's
`/home/<user>/.ssh` directory and immediately removed from the Puppet
Master. The Puppet Master also creates a `/home/<user>/.ssh/config` file
for the target machine's fqdn.

The target machine (holder of the public key) runs the Puppet catalog. The
Puppet Master pushes the public keys related to the target machine, identified
by the machine's fully qualified domain name (FQDN). The target machine then
processes the public keys and adds each to the target users
``/home/<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys` file. This process is idempotent.

Security and Regenerating Keys
------------------------------

For security private keys are never stored on the Puppet Master or anywhere
except the source machine.

Once a key pair is created, subsequent catalog runs can not confirm the
contents of the private key.

Due to the way Puppet executes `File` blocks, both the private and public
key must be removed before a new pair can be regenerated.

First remove the public key from the **Puppet Master**. The key will be in
the `ssh_keys::params::puppet_key_dir` location. The default location is
`/etc/puppet/ssh-keys`. The public key will be inside the target machines
fqdn directory.

Second, remove the private key from the local machine.

The next time puppet runs on the local machine a new keypair will be 
generated. Remember to run puppet on the target machine before trying
to connect using the new key pair.

Troubleshooting
---------------

#### Wrong Header Line Format

If the following error pops up when execting a `ssh_keys::connect` definition:

  err: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: wrong header line format

Make sure the `ssh_keys::params::puppet_key_dir` exists and is owned by the
puppet user:

  mkdir -p /etc/puppet/ssh-keys
  chown -R puppet:puppet /etc/puppet/ssh-keys

#### Zero Size Private Key

If the private key exists by is empty, then an error occurred while
regenerating private key. See the section `Security and Regenerating Keys` for
directions on how to regenerate the key pair.
